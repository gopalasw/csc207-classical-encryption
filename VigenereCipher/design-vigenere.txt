1. This component encodes or decodes a message by cycling through the
characters of a given keyphrase and adding these values to the
corresponding character integers.

2. The main asks the user to input a message and a keyphrase. Then the
method crypt uses these values to cycle through each character and calls
the method codeChar to calculate the change in value of the encoded/decoded
character.

3. We should test when neither encode or decode are inputed by the user, a
case when the length of the key phrase is less than the length of the
message, a case where the length of the keyphrase is equal to the length of
the message, and a case where it is larger, with both the encode and decode
functions.
